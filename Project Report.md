**Project Report: Attendance Tracking System**

**1. Introduction:**
   The Attendance Tracking System is designed to automate the process of tracking student attendance based on their device connections. This system provides a convenient way for instructors to monitor student attendance in classrooms or online sessions.

**2. Objectives:**
   - To automate the process of tracking student attendance.
   - To reduce manual effort required for attendance recording.
   - To provide real-time attendance monitoring.
   - To generate reports on student attendance.

**3. Features:**
   - Load student data from a JSON file.
   - Simulate retrieving connected devices and save device data to a JSON file.
   - Verify attendance by matching connected devices with student MAC IDs.
   - Save attendance records to JSON files.
   - Display attendance information on a web page.
   - Provide a user-friendly interface for viewing attendance details.

**4. Technologies Used:**
   - Python: Flask framework for web development.
   - JSON: Data interchange format for storing student and device data.
   - HTML/CSS: Frontend development for web interface.
   - Jinja2: Templating engine for Flask to render dynamic content.

**5. System Architecture:**
   The system consists of the following components:
   - Flask Application: Handles HTTP requests, loads student data, verifies attendance, and renders HTML templates.
   - JSON Files: Store student data, device data, and attendance records.
   - HTML Templates: Render attendance information on the web page.

**6. Implementation:**
   - The Flask application (`app.py`) loads student data from `students.json` and simulates retrieving connected devices.
   - It verifies attendance by matching connected devices with student MAC IDs and saves attendance records to `present.json` and `absent.json`.
   - The attendance information is displayed on the home page (`index.html`) using Jinja2 templating.

**7. Future Enhancements:**
   - Integration with a database for storing student and attendance data.
   - Authentication and user management for secure access to attendance information.
   - Real-time updates for attendance monitoring.
   - Customizable reports and analytics on student attendance patterns.
   - Mobile app integration for accessing attendance information on the go.

**8. Conclusion:**
   The Attendance Tracking System offers an efficient solution for automating student attendance tracking. By leveraging web technologies and JSON data storage, it provides a scalable and easy-to-use platform for instructors to monitor student attendance effectively.
